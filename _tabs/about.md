Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Mohammad Danish Khan. I am a *software developer* with an experience of over 8 years in this field. 

I am one of the co-founder of a small startup called [cgmpal](https://www.cgmpal.com/#/) and working on another health-tech startup as a co-founder and a software developer. In my spare time I do [mentoring and freelancing](https://www.codementor.io/@dankhan). I have my expertise in C, C++, Python, Django, REST APIs, AWS and IOT (Raspberry Pi).  

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ihaccks).
