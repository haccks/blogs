You can install multiple versions if you need.

>If you have installed multiple versions of python using `port`, e.g. python310, python311 and python312, then each of these will be active and you can switch between them by using the command `python` with their version suffix, e.g. `python3.10`, `python3.11` and `python3.12` respectively, in the terminal. You can make any these versions as the default python by running the `sudo port select --set python3 python<version>` command.

Note that, for each version of python you have installed via `port`, you need to install it's corresponding pip package.
